# ChessProject - Simple Console Chess Game
## Comment

This small project was part of a first semester programming project of my java course. The code is not very efficient and mostly hard-coded, because i wrote this programm in a very short time. I will try to improve it, if i got time. 

Anyway, feel free to use my code ;)

## Information

This project is written in the IntelliJ IDE from JetBrains. So if you want to use my whole project, the easiest way is to use Intellj. Otherwise you can download just the <b>src</b> folder whithin all the <b>.java</b> files.
